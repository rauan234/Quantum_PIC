The function that generates the plots is soft_test_2.

The function which is responsible for the generation of E is Grid.get_EB_at. There are two different options: the one where S is half-shifted all at once, and the one where S is half-shifted for each axis individually. Both produce colorful plots, and these two options are responsible for option_1.png and option_2.png, respectively.
